Jeremy's 2013 Space Halloween Costume
=====================================
These are the code, 3D design, and schematic files that accompany Jeremy Blum's 2013 "Space" Halloween Costume.  
You can watch a video demo of this project [on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-RoAUor-dg).  
More info about this project can be found on [my website](http://www.jeremyblum.com/2013/11/03/halloween)

3D Printed Parts
----------------
1. Print the body as-is.
2. Print four of the fins. You may wish to arrange them all on the build platform for one print.
3. Print the nose cone with a raft and support (for the handle inside).
4. Remove the support material from the nose cone.
5. Super glue all the parts together.

Electronics & Software
----------------------
1. Acquire the parts you'll need:
    * [Cheap Long-Sleeve Black Shirt](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003AU5WBE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B003AU5WBE&linkCode=as2&tag=jeremybcom-20)
    * [Adafruit Flora Budget Pack](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1405)
	* [Adafruit Flora NeoPixels v2 x2](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1260)
2. Take a crash course in wearable electronics: http://learn.adafruit.com/conductive-thread
3. Set up your Adafruit Flora IDE and install the Neopixel Library
    * Getting started with Flora: http://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-flora/overview
	* Getting started with NeoPixels: http://learn.adafruit.com/flora-rgb-smart-pixels/
4. Follow the included schematic and sew everything into your shirt
5. You may want to super glue the contacts once you've sewn them, so they don't untie
5. Load the included software onto your Flora and watch it blink!

*Note: On 4/17/2015 I added another sketch folder (stars-gemma) that works with the Adafruit Gemma instead of the Flora. Setup instructions unique to that platform can be found inside the sketch file.
